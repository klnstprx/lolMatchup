* get current game for a user
* ask the user (maybe i can figure that out from the data) for the opponent laner.
* fetch the champion.
* if its a botlane matchup, fetch 2 champions.

* Actually maybe fetch both teams, and then display the cds and costs for each ability of every champion.
* And then when the user wants more details, he can just click on the champion to see all data.
